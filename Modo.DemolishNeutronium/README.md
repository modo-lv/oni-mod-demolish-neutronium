# Demolish Neutronium
An [Oxygen Not Included](https://store.steampowered.com/app/457140/Oxygen_Not_Included/) (& [Spaced Out!](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1452490/Oxygen_Not_Included__Spaced_Out/)) mod.

## Description
Allows removing Neutronium tiles with the Dig command.

Tired of uneven map edges and geyser platforms messing with your room layouts? Always wanted to run a pipe or a wire directly under a volcano? Now you can!

## Details
* Requires *Super-Duperhard Digging* skill.
* Takes 5 times longer than digging Obsidian (configurable).
* Does not drop any Neutronium.

## Compatibility with other mods

* **[Rocketry Expanded](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2837919908)**: Excavating Neutronium will drop Neutronium Dust (configurable).
* **[Mass-based Digging](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1835785649)**: Excavation times will be different depending on the mass of the Neutronium tile (normally the game only varies dig time for tiles under 400kg).
