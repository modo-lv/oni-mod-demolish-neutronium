# Modo's mods for Oxygen Not Included

## Introduction

See individual `Modo.*` folders. 

## Building

Everything should be ready-to-build, after making sure of correct paths:
* In each project's assembly references.
* In each project's `ILRepack.targets` file.
* In `*.bat` files in the solution root. 
* (Optional) In `.run/*` configs if using JetBrains Rider.
