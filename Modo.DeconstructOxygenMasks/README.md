# Deconstruct Oxygen Masks
An [Oxygen Not Included](https://store.steampowered.com/app/457140/Oxygen_Not_Included/) mod.

## Description
Adds the option to deconstruct Oxygen Masks (including worn ones) and recover the material they are made of.

## Details
* Deconstruction button is added to all Oxygen Masks
  * Deconstruct tool will **not** work! This is to avoid confusion with deconstructing buildings and stay consistent with other item-specific commands (such as emptying canisters).
* Takes half as long as constructing one.
* A deconstructed mask will also drop its oxygen (and any other contents), same as when it is worn out.
* Masks constructed with the mod will be made of the same material that was used in the recipe. 
  * Masks constructed in vanilla game (without the mod) are made of dirt and will drop that.
* The mass of oxygen masks is increased to 50 kg, to recover the full amount of metal ore in the standard crafting recipe.
  * This can be configured in mod options to game's default, or any other custom amount.
